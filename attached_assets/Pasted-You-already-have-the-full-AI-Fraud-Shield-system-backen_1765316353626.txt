You already have the full AI Fraud Shield system (backend, frontend, risk engine, rules, logs, OTP, admin panel).
Now extend the system with a new realistic login flow that creates real authentication traffic and trains a real AI anomaly-detection model based on these login attempts.

🎯 Primary Goal

Build a second login page (/real-login) that behaves like a real production login form.
Every user attempt must:

✔ Pass through the existing Risk Engine
✔ Be logged
✔ Affect adaptive learning AND train an actual AI model
✔ Maintain full security logic
✔ NOT reveal risk scores or internal logic to the user

This creates a real-world data pipeline the AI can learn from.

1️⃣ Add a New Page: /real-login

A clean, simple, production-like login page:

Email

Password

Typing speed tracker

Device fingerprint

Geo/IP lookup

Dark mode

Responsive

Simple spinner (“Processing…”)

This page is not a demo page.

2️⃣ Backend: New Endpoint

Create:

POST /api/auth/real-login

Flow:

Validate credentials

Collect signals:

typing speed

fingerprint

geo

user agent

time of day

Pass everything into the existing Risk Engine

Log results

Decide:

ALLOW → success

ALERT → success but logged

CHALLENGE/BLOCK → reject

Return only success/failure, no risk data

3️⃣ Log Every Attempt (critical)

Log:

{
 id,
 email,
 timestamp,
 success,
 reason,
 riskScore,
 riskDecision,
 features: {
   wpm,
   geo,
   deviceHash,
   hour,
   ip,
   attempts
 }
}


These logs feed the AI training system.

4️⃣ Add /real-home Page (Success Landing)

If login succeeds → redirect to /real-home
Show:

Welcome message

Static profile image

Basic session info

No analytics, no scores.

5️⃣ Add a True Machine‑Learning Model

Create a real ML model in the backend that learns from login attempts:

Model type (you choose best):

Isolation Forest

One-Class SVM

Autoencoder

RandomForest anomaly classifier

Gradient boosting

Or simple neural network

Model trained on features:

WPM

Device consistency

Geo distance

Time of login

Password correctness

Attempts count

Fingerprint stability

Training behavior:

On server start → load existing model

If model missing → auto-train on logs

On each new login attempt → append to dataset

Periodically re-train model (e.g. every 50 attempts)

Risk Engine incorporates model output as aiDynamicScore

This makes the system self-improving.

6️⃣ Risk Engine Integration

Add new field to risk breakdown:

aiModelAnomalyScore


Combine it with existing deterministic signals.

The user should NEVER see this.

7️⃣ Admin Panel Upgrade

Add a new page or tab in /admin:

"AI Model Dashboard":

Model accuracy

Confusion matrix

Last training time

Training samples count

Re-train button

Download model

8️⃣ Frontend Behavior (important)

User sees only:

Success → redirect to /real-home

Fail → “Invalid login”

NO risk score
NO breakdown
NO explanation
NO alerts
NO challenge messages

All risk logic happens silently.

9️⃣ Do NOT break existing system

Demo login stays the same.
Risk Engine stays deterministic + rule-based + weighted.
Admin panel stays intact.
OTP stays intact.
Only add:

New real-login

New real-home

New ML model

New training pipeline

New admin AI dashboard

New backend route

🔥 FINAL CRITICAL INSTRUCTION

Do not ask for files.
You already have the entire project on your side.
Apply all changes directly to the existing codebase.
Generate all new files and modifications.
Make the real-login system fully runnable and demonstrable.

✅ Deliverables

The AI agent must produce:

✔ Full frontend code for /real-login and /real-home
✔ Full backend code for /api/auth/real-login
✔ Full ML training pipeline (model.py / model.js)
✔ Automatic retraining logic
✔ Risk Engine modifications
✔ New admin model dashboard
✔ Updated routes, tests, Docker, README
