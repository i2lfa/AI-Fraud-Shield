Fraud Signals (Include All of These)

Typing Speed Analysis

Measure user keystroke dynamics.

Compare with normal patterns.

Detect bots or unusual typing rhythms.

User Device Fingerprint

OS

Browser

Device model

Screen resolution

User Location (Geolocation)

Compare with previous login locations.

Detect impossible travel.

Detect risky regions.

Login Time Abnormality

Compare with typical login hours.

IP Reputation

Private / proxy / VPN detection.

Known malicious ranges.

Historical Behavioral Profile

Build user behavior baseline automatically.

🧩 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
1️⃣ Frontend (React + Tailwind)

Build a complete modern UI with these pages:

Login Page

Dashboard Page

Fraud Reports Page

User Risk Profile Page

Features:

Real-time fraud indicator while typing

Animated risk score (0–100)

Device + location preview

Clean professional dark UI

Responsive and fast

Use shadcn/ui components

2️⃣ Backend (Python Flask)

Build a full API including:

/api/login

/api/fraud-score

/api/fingerprint

/api/location

/api/history

/api/auth/test-user

Backend Functions Needed:

Calculate fraud risk score (0–100)

Store login attempts in SQLite

Perform location checks

Perform IP/VPN validation

Run typing rhythm analysis

Return full decision:
"allow" | "challenge" | "deny"

3️⃣ AI Model (Local Model or Small Python ML Model)

Train or implement a lightweight ML model that predicts fraud likelihood using all the above inputs.

Explain features & weights.

Provide training script.

Provide inference script.

Provide sample dataset so the system works immediately.

4️⃣ Full System Integration

The agent must:

Connect the frontend login form with Flask API

Send typing-speed events to backend

Send device fingerprint

Send location info

Receive fraud score in real-time

Display risk meter

Show UI warning if login is suspicious

5️⃣ Delivery Requirements

The agent must deliver:

✔ Full React project (all files)
✔ Full Flask project (all files)
✔ ML model files (training + inference)
✔ SQL database schema
✔ API documentation (OpenAPI spec)
✔ Setup instructions (step-by-step)
✔ README.md (detailed)
✔ Run commands for frontend + backend
✔ Architecture diagram
✔ Communication flow diagram
✔ Local development guide
✔ Security considerations
✔ Example test logins
✔ Risk-scoring explanation
