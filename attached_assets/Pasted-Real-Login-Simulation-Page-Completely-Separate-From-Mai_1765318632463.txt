Real Login Simulation Page (Completely Separate From Main Admin Login & Engine Login)

You already have the entire AI Fraud Shield project in your environment.
Now I want you to ADD a NEW login simulation page that is completely SEPARATE from:

the main system login

the admin login

the engine testing pages

the risk simulator

the model playground

⚠️ This new page must NOT authenticate users into the system.
It must ONLY simulate login attempts and send them to the risk engine.

Your tasks:
1. Create a NEW, standalone page at /real-login

This page must be completely separate from:

/login (main admin login)

/simulator (risk engine test)

/model-playground (ML model test)

This is a side page used only to TEST real login attempts, not to enter the system.

It must NOT redirect the user into the dashboard or any protected route.

2. Implement a fully isolated login simulation flow

When a user enters:

username

password

You must:

Send the attempt to the existing Risk Engine

Apply ALL active risk factors:

device fingerprint

IP + geolocation

typing speed

browser metadata

rule‑based scoring

any existing engine logic

⚠️ But none of this internal logic should appear to the user.

3. Every attempt must be logged

Store every attempt in the project's existing logging mechanism.

Log fields (NOT shown to user):

username

timestamp

risk result

detected anomalies

success/failure

full detailed metadata

These will be used for future AI model training.

4. Very simple user-facing output

After evaluating the attempt:

If success →

Show a simple success image or success screen.
No dashboard access, no navigation, no tokens.

If fail →

Show a simple rejection/failure image.
Again, no sensitive info displayed.

⚠️ No risk score, no rule triggers, no IP info, no device info is shown to the user.

5. This page must NOT authenticate the user

It must NOT log the user into the real system

It must NOT grant access to the dashboard

It must NOT issue tokens or sessions

It must NOT replace the real login page

This is purely a realistic login attempt simulator for collecting real-world attempts under the current Risk Engine.

6. The Risk Engine remains isolated

The engine code stays unchanged

This page only calls it

No merging of logic

No modifications to admin login flow

7. Prepare stored attempts for future ML training

Do NOT train a model now.
Just store all input/output data to be used later.

8. Expected final result

A new route /real-login

A standalone page separate from all other login or test pages

Full risk evaluation

Full logging

Minimal success/failure UI

Zero access to the admin or dashboard

All logic hidden from the user
