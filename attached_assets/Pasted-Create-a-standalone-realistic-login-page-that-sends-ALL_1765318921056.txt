Create a standalone, realistic login page that sends ALL login attempts to the Risk Engine, SIEM, Event Logs, and Audit Logs, without giving the user access to any dashboard.
1. New Standalone Page /real-login

Create a completely separate login page, NOT connected to:

/login (admin / internal login)

/engine-login

/simulator

/model-playground

Any dashboard or admin pages

This page is meant to simulate real employees/customers logging into Company A, and every login attempt must be forwarded to external/internal systems.

2. Realistic Login Attempt Flow

When a user enters a username + password:

Collect:

Typing speed (WPM)

Device fingerprint (platform, browser, screen size, OS)

IP + Geo data

Timestamp

Page load time

Package ALL data into a real login attempt object

Send this object to:

External SIEM (Company B)

Internal Risk Engine

Event Log System

Audit Log System

Fraud Detection Subsystem

Any existing monitoring socket listeners

Local log collector for future ML model training

3. Must Trigger ALL Project Logic

Even if the user entered:

Wrong username

Wrong password

Empty inputs

Random name like “Ahmed”

The login attempt must trigger the entire pipeline:

Risk Engine evaluation

Device anomaly scoring

Typing pattern anomaly scoring

Geo drift detection

Time-based behavioral checks

Adaptive learning (if needed)

All webhook triggers

SIEM event forwarding

Event log writing

Audit log entry

Fraud alerts if required

The user sees NONE of these details.

4. User-Facing Screen

After pressing “Login”:

If "accepted" → Show a simple success screen with an image (placeholder OK)

If "rejected" → Show generic failure screen (image or message)

⚠️ Do NOT show:

Scores

Risk breakdown

Why login failed

Internal engine decisions

Alerts

Factors

This page is meant to feel like a real consumer login page, not a developer tool.

5. No Access Granted

This page must NOT:

Log the user into the dashboard

Issue JWTs

Redirect to admin

Expose any internal pages

It is purely a data‑collection endpoint for SIEM + Risk Engine testing.

6. Logging Requirements

Each attempt must be logged into:

logs/real-login.json

Event logs

Audit logs

SIEM stream

Real-time monitoring (socket.io)

Risk Engine history

ML training dataset store

Logs must mask sensitive data:

Password

IP address (partial masking)

7. Sidebar Integration

Add a new sidebar entry:

Real Login (External Engine)


Links to /real-login, fully accessible without authentication.

8. Behaviour Example

User enters:

username: Ahmed
password: 12345


What happens:

Frontend collects metadata

Sends loginAttempt → backend

Backend forwards it to:

SIEM ingestion API

Risk Engine

Event logs

Audit logs

Fraud engine

Real-time monitoring

A log entry is created

The user ONLY sees:

Success (image)
or
Failed (image)

Nothing else is revealed.

9. Purpose

This creates:

A realistic login environment

A safe way to test the entire fraud pipeline

A clean separation between:

User-facing website

Internal security systems

A foundation for future ML model training
