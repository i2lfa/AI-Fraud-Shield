Create a real, fully functional AI Fraud Shield system with:

Normal Login Page (main)

Side Login Page (secondary login page with different style)

Real-time fraud scoring

OTP verification

Admin panel

User panel

Hidden fraud-decision logic

ADDITIONAL NEW FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

Add all the following new features into the system:

Secondary Login Page

Different URL (e.g., /side-login)

Different design/theme

Same backend logic as the main login

The user can log in from either one

Both must fully work and be shown in your final simulation

Fraud Rules That Are Hidden Internally

All decision-making (accept / reject / suspicious)

Must NOT be visible to the user anywhere

Must not be exposed in the UI or logs

Only shown to admin in a secure hidden admin tab

Explain the hidden logic structure, but do NOT show it to the user-facing components

Admin Secret Dashboard Panel

Hidden unless logged in as admin

Shows:

Hidden fraud scoring logs

All login attempts

Device fingerprints

Risk heatmap

Severity badges

Only the admin sees this panel

Improved Fraud AI Engine
Add:

Behavioral analysis

IP reputation check

Impossible travel detection

Velocity check

Suspicious browser pattern detection

Bot-like click timing score
Make it modular & extensible.

Architecture

Model flow

Backend routing

Frontend structure

FULLY RUNNABLE + DEMONSTRATED
At the end, show everything running from your side as if it’s a real website:

Main Login Page

Side Login Page

OTP Page

Dashboard

Admin Panel

Fraud analysis results (admin only)

Example login attempts

Example risk alerts

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT

❗ All fraud decision logic that determines Accept / Reject / Suspicious must stay completely hidden from users.
Do NOT show the rules or scores in the user interface.
Only admin should see them in the secret admin view.

FINAL OUTPUT MUST INCLUDE

Rebuilt full project

Clean folder structure

Complete code

Working simulation of every interface

Working endpoints

Fully running system demo from your side

Admin + user flows

OTP flow

Hidden rules

Side login page with different design

Everything styled and polished
