AI Fraud Shield – Full Production-Ready Implementation"

You are an expert full-stack developer. Your task is to fully build a production-ready AI security system called AI Fraud Shield, including all frontend and backend components, all pages, logic, and UI. The system monitors and analyzes user login behavior in real-time to detect fraud and automatically trigger security responses.

1️⃣ Core Concept (Clearly Defined)

AI Fraud Shield detects fraud during login by analyzing behavioral and contextual anomalies:

Device drift (changes in user device)

Geo-location drift (login from unusual regions)

Typing behavior deviation (speed/keystroke patterns)

Login time anomaly (outside typical login window)

Login attempts frequency (too many attempts)

Comparison with baseline user behavior

The system computes a Risk Score (0–100) and triggers a Decision: Allow / Alert / Challenge / Block.

2️⃣ Functional Requirements

You must implement all the following components with full functionality:

A) Behavior Analysis Breakdown Panel

Display per login attempt:

Device Drift Score

Geo Drift Score

Typing Drift Score

Login Time Anomaly

Attempts Count Score

Final Risk Score

Explanation of decision

UI Example:

Risk Breakdown:
- Device drift: +30
- Geo drift: +25
- Typing drift: +25
- Attempts multiplier: +10
- Time anomaly: +10
Final Score: 100 (Critical)
Decision: BLOCK

B) Baseline User Behavioral Profile Page

Show for each user:

Primary device

Primary region

Average typing speed

Typical login window

Risk history graph

Drift % vs current session

C) Event Logs Page (SIEM-style)

Table with columns: Timestamp | User | Device | Geo | Risk | Decision | Reason | Latency

Support filtering, severity colors, badges

D) User Risk History Page

Timeline of user's risk over time

Line chart of Risk Score

List of past login events

Severity categories

E) Security Response Rules Page

Admin page to configure rules:

Block if risk > X

Challenge if risk > Y

Alert if risk > Z

Allow if risk <= Z

Include toggles/sliders/save functionality

F) Real-Time Risk Simulator Page

Inputs: Device, Geo, Typing speed slider, Login attempts, Time of day

Outputs: Real-time Risk Score, Decision, Full breakdown

G) Enhanced Dashboard

Risk distribution graph

Geographic login map

Device type statistics

Top risky users

Real-time event feed

3️⃣ Frontend Requirements

React (Next.js or Vite)

TailwindCSS

Recharts for charts/graphs

Dark-themed, modern, clean UI

Reusable components

Fully responsive

4️⃣ Backend Requirements

Node.js + Express

REST API Endpoints:

/api/risk/calc → returns risk score + breakdown

/api/risk/simulate → for simulator

/api/logs → returns event logs

/api/user/:id/baseline

/api/user/:id/risk-history

/api/rules → get/update security rules

Fully implement risk scoring logic based on inputs

5️⃣ Data Requirements

Include default datasets (users.json, logs.json, rules.json) for demo/testing

Support extension to database (optional)

Preload sample users and login events

6️⃣ Delivery Requirements

You must output everything needed for a fully working project:

Full folder structure

All frontend React components

All backend endpoints

All pages fully implemented

No placeholders, all logic implemented

Fully working project ready to run locally

Include sample data for testing

7️⃣ Optional Enhancements

Admin can modify baseline values

Real-time feed updates automatically

Color-coded severity in all logs/pages

Reusable UI components (cards, tables, graphs, sliders, modals)

Goal: Deliver a 100% complete, fully functional AI Fraud Shield system ready for deployment, testing, or demonstration, with no missing parts or placeholders.
